GTick TODO List
===============

* Bugs in Pulseaudio support:
  - Visual tick unsynchronized / bad display
  - Re-initialization of dsp/pulseaudio device upon prefs change
  - Config entry of Sound System on Start

* sub beats
* start actual beat at time of setting speed (?)
* save settings periodically, also on every profile saved
* set to defaults
* extend test suite, add resource check for FDs

Further ideas:
* Accent ticks: lower pitch instead of higher
* Bugs:
  - Sounds correct (all platforms)?
* start gtick in running state
* not only normal and accentuated tick, but one of the following:
  - third state for each tick: off
  - list of sounds (built-in, sound files) for each tick to choose from
* GLADE integration
* Implement PC Speaker output
* Feedback: Playing statistics (std. deviation, ...)
* Info: Sample rate, device, ...

* generalize gtick (library?) for:
  - GTK standalone mode (currently)
  - console mode (interactive, record to file, ...)
  - XMMS plugin
  
* ALSA support
* JACK support
