GNU GTick - The Metronome

This software is part of the GNU Project.

Welcome to GTick, a metronome application written using the GTK+ widget set.
This application was written because of a need for a Linux (or UN*X) based
metronome program.

Having seen similar programs for Win95 (not really seen but at least noticed
links to on various search engines), and not seen any for Linux/Un*x, Alex
decided to go for it and wrote his own. Since then, many changes have been made
to GTick, most importantly a more robust timing engine was added in 2003.

GTick has a BPM (Beats Per Minute) scale of 30bpm to 250bpm, catering for
almost any need; and it is known to work on Linux (Kernel 2.2.x to 2.6.x) and
FreeBSD.  It was initially developed using GTK+ 1.1.14, but moved to GTK+ 2.x.

This is still in development, so there are likely to be bugs; So use it at your
own risk, I can't be held responsible for anything bad happening to your
computer or your life.

To use external ticking sounds you need libsndfile, at least version 1.

If you find a bug, have any comments or ideas, then email me,
stigge@antcom.de or preferably the GTick development mailing list at
gtick-devel@gnu.org.

I "hijacked" this package because Alex doesn't respond to any mail and the
package needed urgent work to be useable at all. Later, I got an email from
him. He is fine and is still tracking GTick's progress.

Visit the GTick homepage at http://www.antcom.de/gtick/ for the latest release
of GTick. And don't forget, the most important thing, HAVE FUN!!!

Thanks
